# Intro

# Getting started

## Fixing your headers

### Correcting the exposure time



### Computing the effective airmass

# Standard Star Photometry and Reduction

## Obtaining Aperture Photometry of your standards
## Picking an aperture size
## Setting things up
## Doing it: Aperture photometry at last

### Automatic star finding
### Photometry by eye

WTF?

## Examining results: the power of txdump

## The Standard Star solutions
## Making the standard star catalog
## Making the standard star observations file
## Defining the transforms
## Solving the transformation equations

# Crowded field photometry: IRAF/daophot
## Historical summary

Yeah, this will need to be updated

## `daophot` overview
## How big is a star: a few useful definitions
## Setting up the parameter files "daopars" and "datapars"
## Finding stars: `daofind` and `tvmark`
## Aperture photometry with `phot`
## Making the PSF with `psf`
## Doing the PSF fitting: `allstar`
## Matching the frames
## Determining the aperture correction
## `daophot` summary

# Transforming to the standard system.
